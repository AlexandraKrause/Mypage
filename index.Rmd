My goal is to gather as much knowledge as possible from both fields of agricultural and forestry sciences. I want to deepen and pass on my existing knowledge during my studies.

So, in 2018, I completed my B.Sc. in Forest Sciences and Forest Ecology at the Georg-August-University of Göttingen. Now I am studying Crop Sciences at the Faculty of Agriculture of the Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms-University of Bonn. 

Many internships helped me learn about the different areas of agriculture, horticulture, and forestry. During nine months in total, I gained several experiences, first with a district forester and on an ecological managed farm, before I got to know the work in research, consulting, and at the ministry.

During my studies, I can regularly improve my statistical and computer skills (mainly R, Python, GIS), gain new experience, and generally deepen my knowledge of agriculture, forestry, and horticultural sciences. The spectrum of knowledge I access allows me to get excited about my studies every day.

My master thesis focuses on gender inclusion in agricultural studies. Therefore, I researched factors influencing rural farm women’s empowerment in agricultural development using the Decision Analysis methodology.
